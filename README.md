## Overview
Pdf2Leads is a platform that allows admins to upload PDFs and control access to them. The web app automatically blurs the restricted pages and generates forms for user interactions. It processes PDFs in the background to ensure seamless performance. Leads are generated based on user interactions, and admins and superadmins receive detailed insights into lead data.
